# Model Training on Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on data analysis and predictive modeling using the diamonds dataset. The primary objective is to explore, visualize, and build machine learning models to predict diamond prices based on various features. All analysis and modeling are performed in a Jupyter notebook for reproducibility and clarity.

## Project Structure
- `diamonds.csv`: The dataset containing diamond attributes and prices.
- `notebooks_data analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and model training steps.
- `readme.md`: Project documentation and instructions.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the diamonds dataset
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Visualization of key insights
- Model training and evaluation (regression models)
- Performance metrics and comparison

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files.
2. **Install Python and Jupyter Notebook** (if not already installed).
3. **Install required packages**:
	- pandas
	- numpy
	- matplotlib
	- seaborn
	- scikit-learn
	- (other packages as needed)
4. **Open the notebook** `notebooks_data analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
5. **Run the cells** sequentially to reproduce the analysis and modeling steps.

## Usage
The notebook guides you through:
- Loading and inspecting the diamonds dataset
- Visualizing distributions and relationships
- Preparing data for modeling
- Training regression models to predict price
- Evaluating model performance

## Requirements
